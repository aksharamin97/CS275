<h1>
	The Fibonacci Sequence
</h1>	
<p>
	Fibonacci numbers are part of a common mathematical sequence called the fibonacci sequence. The numbers are denoted by the variable Fn. The basis of the sequence is that a number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from a 0 and a 1. Fibonacci numbers are named after an Italian mathematician Leonard of Pisa "aka Fibonacci". They started in mathematics as early as 200 BC by Pingala who worked on enumerating patterns.
